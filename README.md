welch periodogram for RR intervals


This is the Python code for Welch periodogram applied to an annotated
RR intervals time series.

**I do not think this is the correct approach to calculating the
  spectrum of the RR intervals time series** so use responsibly and do
  not use the existence of this repository to justify your use of Welch for RR.
